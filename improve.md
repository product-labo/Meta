I want users to go through an onboarding process so there can be a default contract address for every user while still able to use the analyses feature for other analysis (keep all current features and pages jus add these features). The dashbaord should display their default contract address metrics and the analysis page the over-all user's analyses metrics (total analyses etc.). for the onboarding form; social links, website, logo, chain, contract address, abi, purpose, sart date, category[defi, nft etc.] after add it should go through the indexing process what we have currently (use the current radar feature) to dashboard

I think there's no rpcclient for ethereum; make indexing based contract interaction works for lisk, ethereum and starknet, test using addresses from env, create different scenario test based on the target and competitors
